System of Linear Equations
--------------------------

For a given linear system, the two fundamental questions is:

1. (**Existence**)Is the system consistent; that is,does at least one solution exist?
2. (**Uniqueness**)If a solution exists, is it the only one; that is,is the solution unique?

Elementary Row Operations
-------------------------

Elementary row operations do not change the solution set of a given linear system. Use row operations to eliminate unknowns one by one can simply the calculations.

1. (**Replacement**)Replace one row bythe sum of itself and a multiple ofanother row
2. (**Interchange**)Interchange two rows
3. (**Scaling**)Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant

Glossary
--------

Linear System
-------------

a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables

Solution Set
------------

All possible solutions of the linear system

System Equivalent
-----------------

Two linear systems are called equivalent if they have the same solution set
