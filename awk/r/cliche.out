All's well that ends well.
All's well that is master of none.
Every man gathers no moss.
He who lives by the sword abhors a vacuum.
A rolling stone abhors a vacuum.
All's well that abhors a vacuum.
History gathers no moss.
Every man gathers no moss.
All's well that is master of none.
He who lives by the sword repeats itself.
